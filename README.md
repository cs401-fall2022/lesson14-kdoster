# Typescript Project - IN PROGRESS
CS 401 Labs 6-8
## Progress
I have an idea of what is to happen with everything, just needs to be implemented
## Timeline
Because of me being busy and then sick, I have gotten behind on these projects. My current timeline is to ideally get everything done on Saturday 10/21, but if that does not end up happening like I hope, then it'll get done on Sunday or Monday, depending on how long my commitments on Sunday take.
