        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Typescript is a language similar to Javascript. It takes the features that Javascript has to offer, and makes
            it more "strict," but not in the sense of "strict functions." Like the name implies, it adds the strictness
            into the typing of variables. Javascript is very loose on asserting that you use consistent typing, but
            Typescript enforces it, making code writing, reading, and debugging much clearer and easier. It also makes
            it much closer to Object Oriented Programming Languages like Java and C++.</p>

        <h2>Types</h2>
        <p>Typescript takes the already existing types within Javascript and makes them be consistent across the document.</p>
        <h3>Javascript types</h3>
        <p>List types in Javascript, and how Typescript enforces this (Static type-checking.</p>
        <h3>Inferencing types</h3>
        <p>Show how Typescript can determine what type a variable is</p>
        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Demonstrate interfaces and how they can be used to enforce consistnency</p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous (TBD)</h3>
